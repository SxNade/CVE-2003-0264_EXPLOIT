# CVE-2003-0264_EXPLOIT
Buffer Overflow in Seattle Lab Mail (SLmail) 5.5 - POP3

*`Simple STACK BAsed BUffer Overflow Step By Step`*

# 1) FUZZ The Application

`In the very First Step we will Fuzz The Application With a Simple Spike Script`

`meanwhile we wil also have SLmail attached[and running] to immunity Debugger`

*More On Spike:: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/intro-to-fuzzing/*

*In Here is a Simple Spike Script named spike_fuzz.spk*

`we will run it against the application using command`

      line_send_tcp 192.168.1.117 110 spike_fuzz.spk

`where 192.168.1.117 is the IP of Target Machine Running SLMail and it is Running On Port 110`

*Meanwhile if we see immunity we will see that the application has crashed*

# 2) POC For Replicating the Crash

`Now we will create a python POC that Replicates the crash and calculates the bytes at which the application crashes`

               python poc_crash.py

# 3) Finding The Offset

`For Finding the offset we will utilize msf`


          1. First Generate a pattern
          2. Note the EIP
          3. Query that EIP and Length with MSF to Find the Offset


`msf-pattern_create -l 2700`

*In poc_offset.py we will utilize this pattern as our Overflow Buffer!*

           python poc_offset.py
